I'm a self-motivated, collaborative, and adventurous researcher.

Self-motivated
A defining trait of mine is self-motivation. I carry steady, positive energy grounded in a strong belief in myself. I learn through direct experience—by trying, adjusting, and at times failing. These moments of trial and error lead to outcomes that are uniquely my own, and I find great satisfaction in sharing them with the world. I have a strong inner resilience; perhaps that’s why I’m deeply interested in urban resilience as well.

Collaborative
I enjoy working with openness and flexibility.
In Korea, I served as a student ambassador in various landscape-related organizations and gained hands-on experience at landscape design and construction firms. Internationally, I completed short-term exchange programs in Australia and Japan, and traveled solo across both the eastern and western United States.
These experiences have shaped me into someone who connects easily and communicates well with others. I take pride in being a proactive and reliable contributor in collaborative, community-based settings.

Adventurous
I find joy in challenge and exploration. There is a unique fulfillment in seeking new directions and moving forward with curiosity. For me, a spirit of adventure begins with a broad and thoughtful perspective.
To delve deeper into landscape architecture, I continuously expand my scope—exploring urban ecology, geoscience, evolutionary biology, computer science, philosophy, and art; and on a more personal level, music, exercising, and reading as well.
